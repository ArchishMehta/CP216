Task 1
From the compiler you know the errors are on line 21 and 23, although their are logic errors way 
before those lines that cause other errors.

On line 19, ldr r3, A; is not the correct way to load a value and should be ldr r3, = A. This loads
the address of A into r3.

On line 21, the same mistake as the previous one occurs and should be ldr r3, = B.

On line 23, add r2, r1, [r0] is incorrect because [r0] refers to a memory address so that addition
isn't valid so it chould be changed to add r2,r1,r0.

Task 2

From the compiler we have logic errors at line 26 and 30 so decoding from the top of the code is a
good idea.

On line 26, str r2, r3 this is the incorrect way to use the store function. You need r3 to be the memory
address to write to so it would be str r2, [r3]

On line 30, the same error as the previous occurs and should be changed to str r2, [r3]

On line 29, their is a typo and it should be changed to ldr r3, = Diff

On line 44, .space2 is incorrect because the minimum amount of bytes you must set aside is 4 so it should
be .space 4

Task 3
The compiler says we only have one error but since it's a logic error it's a good idea to start from the top

On line 18, .text is repeated and isn't needed so remove it.

On line 25 and 26, this is the incorrect way to move to the next element. #2 only move 2 bytes forward but to
move to the next element you need to increment by 4 bytes. By incrementing it by 4, it can access each element
in Vec1 and copy it to Vec2

On line 29, the comment is misleading since it is the same as the comment on line 24. The comment should say
//copy the contents of the third element of Vec1 to Vec2
the code for this is the same as the one I improved on line 25 and 26

On line 30 it should be add r0,r0, #4 instead of r1,r1, #4 and line 33 should store r1 and not r0 so it should be 
str r2,[r1]
